## Configuration

1. Clone the repository inside your plugins directory in your ZSH_CUSTOM path, e.g. `$HOME/.ohmyzsh-custom/plugins/`

2. [Set your language project path and your language identifier inside the script](https://github.com/MarcosSegovia/open-create-projects/blob/master/open-create-projects.plugin.zsh#L1-L9)

3. Create an alias that matches the script following the language identifier, e.g.
`alias cdvo="open_create_projects php"`

4. Be sure you have created a command-line launcher with your jetbrains IDE. `Tools` -> `Create Command-line Launcher` -> set to default (e.g. /usr/local/bin/phpstorm)
